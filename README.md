# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

The back-end project is focused on creating a server for the WTWR application. This project will focus on creating, retreiving, updating, and deleting user data from the application. This application will be using Node.js and Express.js for the languages and will feature a linter. Testing will be done on Postman while our database is hosted on MongoDB. The eventual goal is to create a server with an API and user authorization.

## Running the Project

`npm run start` — to launch the server

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature

### Testing

Before committing your code, make sure you edit the file `sprint.txt` in the root folder. The file `sprint.txt` should contain the number of the sprint you're currently working on. For ex. 12
